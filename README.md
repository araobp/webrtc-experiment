# webrtc-experiment

(Work in progress)

## Motivation

Bottlenecks in Digital Twin are:
- GPU (or heat generated by GPU)
- Network latency and network bandwidth

In this project, I will study WebRTC that will be a critical part of Digital Twin, I suppose.

I used to be a SIP expert, so I have already understood the communication protocols standardized by IETF. This time, I will study WebRTC's JavaScript APIs standardized by W3C.

## Operation

```
$ node server.js
```

That's it.
