# WebRTC experiments

(Work in progress)

## Motivation

Bottlenecks in Digital Twin are:
- GPU (or heat generated by GPU)
- Network latency and network bandwidth

In this project, I will study WebRTC that will be a critical part of Digital Twin, I suppose.

I used to be a SIP expert, so I have already understood the communication protocols standardized by IETF. This time, I will study WebRTC's JavaScript APIs standardized by W3C.

## Operation

```
$ node server.js
```

That's it.

## My other projects on WebRTC

These days I have been testing Unity Render Streaming. However, honestly speaking, I would rather prefer "just streaming screen capture" than Unity Render Streaming, for digital twin creation -- Unity Render Streaming is very complicated.

NTT Communications provides a very nice (and also very simple) WebRTC platform service. What an excellent company NTT Communications is!

## WebRTC servers

### NTT Communications SkyWay

This project use this server: [NTT Communications SkyWay](https://webrtc.ecl.ntt.com/en/)

### RTCMulticonnections

I have been using this WebRTC server in my job: [RTCMulticonnections](https://github.com/muaz-khan/RTCMultiConnection)
